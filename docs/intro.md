## Introduction

**Welcome to our introductory session on Nextflow - Go with the Next(flow)!**

Nextflow is a powerful workflow language designed to streamline complex computational workflows, often used in fields like bioinformatics. Our goal today is not to transform you into overnight coding experts or bioinformatics scientists. Instead, we aim to bridge the understanding between our team and the users who rely on Nextflow.

By the end of this session, you'll grasp the essentials: why Nextflow is a game-changer in managing large-scale data analysis and how it empowers our customers to achieve remarkable scientific breakthroughs with efficiency and flexibility. More specifically, this session will highlight key capabilities of Nextflow:

- Scalability
- Parallelism
- Reproducibility
- Resumability
- Reporting
- Flexibility

This knowledge will enhance your ability to connect with our customers, addressing their needs and inquiries with greater empathy and insight.

Let's start with defining our goal: distinguising cats from dogs. Given how difficult of a task this is, we'll be teaching a computer to distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs using a machine learning model.

To start, let's take a look at how we can use existing tools to achieve this task of classification. Go to Part 1.
